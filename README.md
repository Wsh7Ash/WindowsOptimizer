## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

- Always create a system restore point before running optimizations (automatically done by the script)
- Some optimizations may require a system restart
- Not all optimizations may be suitable for every system
- Review the changes before applying them

## üõ°Ô∏è Safety Features

- Automatic system restore point creation
- Error handling for each optimization
- Confirmation prompts for major changes
- Easy-to-use menu interface
