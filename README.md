## üìã Requirements

- Windows 10/11
- PowerShell 5.1 or later
- Administrator privileges

## üîß Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Wsh7Ash/WindowsOptimizer.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd WindowsOptimizer
```

## üíª Usage

### Main Optimizer
1. Right-click on `WindowsOptimizer.ps1` and select "Run with PowerShell as Administrator"
   
   OR

2. Open PowerShell as Administrator and run:
```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force
.\WindowsOptimizer.ps1
```

### Watermark Removal
To remove the Windows activation watermark:
```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force
.\RemoveWatermark.ps1
```

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: The watermark removal script:
- Creates a system restore point before making changes
- Backs up modified system files
- Requires a system restart to take effect
- May need to be run again after major Windows updates

3. Select optimization options from the menu:
```
================ Windows System Optimizer ================
1: Memory Optimization
2: CPU Optimization
3: GPU Optimization
4: Service Optimization
5: Network Optimization
6: Storage Optimization
7: Privacy Optimization
8: Windows Debloater
9: Gaming Optimization
10: Security Optimization
11: Advanced System Optimization
12: Run All Optimizations
Q: Quit
====================================================
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

- Always create a system restore point before running optimizations (automatically done by the script)
- Some optimizations may require a system restart
- Not all optimizations may be suitable for every system
- Review the changes before applying them
- The Windows Debloater will remove pre-installed apps and features
- Some security features may need to be adjusted based on your needs
- Gaming optimizations may affect non-gaming applications

## üõ°Ô∏è Safety Features

- Automatic system restore point creation
- Error handling for each optimization
- Confirmation prompts for major changes
- Easy-to-use menu interface
- Safe removal of Windows components
- Reversible optimizations
- Detailed status reporting
